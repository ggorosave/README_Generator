## Description
Coding is hard work and sometimes it can really work up an appetite. However, we donâ€™t always have time to step away from the computer to cook. Pancake Generator is an application that allows users to select ingredients for their desired pancakes, push a button to order,  and the application will eject warm, fresh pancakes straight from the void to your table.
