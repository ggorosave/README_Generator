# README Generator
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

## Description
A README is an essential part of any software or web development project. However, writing READMEs can be overwhelming for some new developers. This is a command line application that prompts the user with a series of questions about their project and generates a README for their repo. This README was generated using this application although I have made some additions--such as the demo video--since generating it. I used JavaScript and the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to complete this project.
